		<PAR4 V0="Finally, after careful scrutiny, we were left with X publications reporting Y studies." V1="So, at the end of the review we have identified X reports of Y trials."/>
		<PAR5 V0="Finally, after careful scrutiny, we were left with X publications reporting a single study." V1="So, at the end of the review we have identified X reports of one trial."/>
		<PAR6 V0="Finally, after careful scrutiny, we were left with one publication reporting a single study." V1="So, at the end of the review we have identified a single report of one trial."/>
		<PAR7 V0="Finally, after careful scrutiny, we were left with no reports at all. We identified no relevant studies." V1="So, at the end of the review we have identified not a single report of a trial in this area."/>

	<ABSTRACT>
		<ABS_OBJECTIVES V0="To review the effects of X."/>
		<ABS_SEARCH_STRATEGY V0="We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Trials Register (last update search D/M/Y) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and registries of Clinical Trials. There is no language, date, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register."/>
		<ABS_SELECTION_CRITERIA V0="All randomised clinical trials focusing on X."/>
		<ABS_DATA_COLLECTION V0="We extracted data independently. For binary outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we estimated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its 95% CI. We employed a fixed-effect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE."/>
